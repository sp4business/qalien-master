# Content Type Classification Test Guide

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Non-Marketing Content (Should FAIL)
- **Test**: Upload a personal video (e.g., video of your dog, family vacation, random scenery)
- **Expected Result**: 
  - Classification: "Non-Marketing"
  - Result: FAIL
  - Reasoning: "This appears to be personal content without any marketing or promotional intent"

### 2. UGC Marketing Content (Should PASS)
- **Test**: Upload a user-generated style ad (e.g., TikTok product review, Instagram reel promoting a product)
- **Expected Result**:
  - Classification: "UGC"
  - Result: PASS
  - Reasoning: "Authentic user-generated content with clear marketing intent"

### 3. Branded Commercial (Should PASS)
- **Test**: Upload a professional advertisement
- **Expected Result**:
  - Classification: "Branded"
  - Result: PASS
  - Reasoning: "Professional advertisement with clear marketing goals"

## What to Look For

- **Marketing Intent Detection**: The system should correctly identify whether content has promotional/marketing intent
- **Style Classification**: For marketing content, it should distinguish between UGC and Branded styles
- **Pass/Fail Logic**: Only Non-Marketing content should fail; both UGC and Branded marketing content should pass
- **Clear Reasoning**: Each classification should include a clear explanation
